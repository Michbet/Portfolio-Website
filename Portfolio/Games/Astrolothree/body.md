# Astrolothree

### Team
Dylan T Moss, Jonica Brooks, Silvano Gallegos

### Role
Programmer, Game Designer, and Project Lead

## Background
This was for a week long game jam host by SGDA during the spring semester of 2021 and the theme for the jam was "Rule of Three". The team consisted of my roommate and two people that I had never met, and it was all done virtual. I was the only one with prior game development experience I ended up leading the team.

## Summary
We ended up making a top down wave based survival-arcade game, where the player has 3 forms and each form is more or less effective against different enemy forms. It also takes advantage of a free high-score api to keep track of high-scores over the internet.

## What I Contributed
* Came up with the original idea for the game
* all of the player controls 
* The high-score system implementation and scene
* Implement unity's 2D light renderer and post processing
    - This can be seen with the bloom for the character
* Created an emission map for the character sprite-sheet
* Created the wave system
* All sounds effects
* Distributed tasks to other team members
